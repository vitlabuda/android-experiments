# MVVMNotepad
MVVMNotepad is a simple experimental notepad Android app built using the MVVM architecture. It uses ViewModel, LiveData, Repository and Room to store, manage and view the notes.

It is based primarily on [this video tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrnPJCHvNZuDihTpkRs6SpZhqgBqPU118) by *Coding in Flow*, but I slightly modified some of the principles (= I didn't just copy-paste the code) and added a few more things.
