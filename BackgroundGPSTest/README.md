# BackgroundGPSTest
BackgroundGPSTest is an experimental Android app that listens for GPS location updates in backgrounds and prints them to the logcat. In addition, it also scans for nearby Wi-Fi networks and prints them to the logcat too (as scanning Wi-Fi networks has a lot in common with GPS scanning, e.g. in relation to Android permissions).

The app has no practical use; I programmed this app just to learn things associated with background GPS scanning (battery optimizations in recent Android versions, the LocationManager class, requesting permissions etc.)
