# BackgroundGPSTest
BackgroundGPSTest is an experimental Android app that listens for GPS location updates in backgrounds and prints them to the logcat.

The app has no practical use; I programmed this app just to learn things associated with background GPS scanning (battery optimizations in recent Android versions, the LocationManager class, requesting permissions etc.)
